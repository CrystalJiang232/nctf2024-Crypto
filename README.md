# nctf2024-Crypto
Official nctf2024-crypto challenges archive by Hibiscus.  
Three challenges are 绮云(QiYun), Arcahv and Sign respectively.  
All of which are interactive questions focusing on assymetric cryptography with relatively hard difficulty.  

> Note: During the contest, dynamic flag is applied by injecting environment variable "$FLAG$" into the container's environment upon the initialization of the build process. The flag has the format "nctf{GUID}".  
> Thus to build the challenge locally, you might need to ~~somehow~~ tweak with the dockerfile.
