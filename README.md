# nctf2024-Crypto
Official nctf2024-crypto challenges archive by Hibiscus.  
Three challenges are 绮云(QiYun), Arcahv and Sign respectively, all of which are interactive questions focusing on assymetric cryptography with relatively hard difficulty.  

> Note: During the contest, dynamic flag is applied by injecting environment variable "$FLAG$" into the container's environment upon its build initialization. The flag has the format "nctf{GUID}".
> Thus to build the challenge locally you might need to manually tweak with the dockerfile.
